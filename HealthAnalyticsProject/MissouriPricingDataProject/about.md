### Missouri Hospital Chargemaster Pricing Comparison Project
##### Murugesan Raju and Jordan Smith

#### Background:
Under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ [price-transparency law](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-fy-2019-medicare-hospital-inpatient-prospective-payment-system-ipps-and-long-term-acute-0) that took effect on Jan. 1, all hospitals operating in the US are required “to make public a list of their standard charges via the Internet in a machine readable format, and to update this information at least annually, or more often as appropriate.” The landmark legislation expands on a previous requirement that required hospitals to present their standard price lists, or “chargemaster,” upon request.

#### Relevance/Significance:
This is the first time that US healthcare consumers can directly access and compare pricing data amount hospitals.  Unfortunately, do to the “machine readable format” clause in the law, most of these price lists are hard for the average consumer to understand. In addition, most of the chargemasters are in non-standard formats, which makes price comparison for the consumer difficult.

#### Project Aim:
Our project aims to assist Missouri healthcare consumers understand the price differences for selected items/services between hospitals. The main goal is to mine multiple Missouri hospital price lists—with R and Python-—in order to extract comparable items/services.  Furthermore, to present the sets of pricing data in an easily-digestible, interactive, human-readable output.

#### Secondary aims:
Once the initial pricing comparisons can be made, we can examine geographic/population/political distributions of hospitals, to investigate if there may be patterns in hospital pricing that a healthcare consumer might use in making healthcare decisions

For example: is it cheaper to have an elective procedure in a rural hospital or an urban hospital? Does procedure price depend on hospital size or revenue?.

#### Data sets:
We have made a list of Missouri hospitals, with some demographic statistics, it is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsQHyG8YsC222FXeKYcpxS0Y3jjkj10lgDa6DqUbCN8/edit?usp=sharing).

A folder containing the raw forms of our downloaded Missouri chargemasters are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zf01aqZOgK0t8Aqt3x8fq-BCUrXTdJsj?usp=sharing).
